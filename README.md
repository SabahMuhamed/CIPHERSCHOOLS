# React Code Editor

## Overview

React Code Editor is a fully responsive online IDE built with **React** that allows users to write, edit, and preview code in real time.
I built this project using **Sandpack Editor** for live preview functionality and implemented a **file explorer sidebar** for smooth file management â€” just like a desktop IDE.

The application features **authentication with protected routes**, **data persistence**, and **cloud sync** across devices.
It also includes a secure backend built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## Features

### Frontend (React)

* Live preview code editor built using **Sandpack**.
* Sidebar-based file explorer for managing multiple files.
* Authentication system with **Signup** and **Login** pages.
* **Protected Routes** to prevent unauthorized access.
* **LocalStorage** for persistent user sessions.
* Fully **responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

* REST API for handling user authentication and project management.
* Encrypted password storage using **bcrypt**.
* User and file data stored securely in **MongoDB Compass**.
* Ability for users to access and edit saved projects from any device.

## Security Highlights

* Passwords are hashed securely using **bcrypt** before storage.
* **JWT authentication** ensures secure and verifiable user sessions.
* **Protected routes** prevent unauthorized access.
* **LocalStorage** is used only for non-sensitive session persistence.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add syntax highlighting themes (light/dark mode).
* Implement project sharing with public/private access links.
* Add cloud file storage (AWS S3).
* Support for multiple programming languages.
* Enable real-time collaborative editing using **Socket.io**.
